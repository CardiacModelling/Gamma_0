# The relationship between initial concentrations and steady pacing response of action potential models

This GitHub repo was design to facilitate the reproduction of the results published in the paper linked to this GitHub.

Note that to be able to run the Python code, one needs to have installed the Python packages:
  - Myokit: https://github.com/MichaelClerx/myokit 
  Myokit: A simple interface to cardiac cellular electrophysiology Michael Clerx, Pieter Collins, Enno de Lange, Paul   G.A. Volders 2016 Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology Volume 120, issues 1-3, pages 100-114, 
  doi:  10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.12.008
  
  - SABS_project: https://github.com/rcw5890/SABS_project
  This package is an interface to Myokit that was used for the present project. Note that Myokit is the engine that sets up the simulation, and solves it using SUNDIALS solver.
