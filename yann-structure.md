# Proposed structure for gamma-0 paper

Introduction
 - why AP models
 - V can be written in two ways, issues have been shown by various authors
 - In this study we 
   - generalise a bit further? not sure if we do!
   - re-emphasise gamma0 should be considered when comparing models
   - newly show how it will affect model fitting
Methods
 - Our code is here
 - We got models from PMR
 - We ran simulations with myokit and weblab
 - We got initial conditions from models
Models of Vm
 - Two formulations
 - Gamma0 in various models 
 - Quiescent steady state
   - Depends on gamma 0
 - Limit cycle
   - Depends on gamma 0
Influence of gamma 0
  - On model outputs (methods 2.4, plus results 3.3)
  - On pacing to a 'steady state' (tolerance fig from methods 2.1, plus results 3.4)
  - On fitting results (method 2.5, plus results 3.6)
  - Experimental estimation of gamma0
Discussion and conclusion
 - Summary of everything so far
 - Recap what came before, highlight any disagreement, stress what is novel in this paper
 - Address study limitations
 - Make recommendation for considering gamma0
   - link to livshitz 4 rules for model comparison
   - but we say new stuff about fitting
 - Hint at future work
